1. Declaring a variable and initialising with a type ambiguous literal (float
or int) requires the explicit specification of a type. We do not provide a
default.

2. Types declared in a file go into their package symbol table.
The types in the builtin package are copied into every package's symbol table.
Types imported with a use statement go into the import's module symbol table.
With a use as import the imported package goes into the module symbol table.

3. Concrete types are not allowed to have bodiless methods.
