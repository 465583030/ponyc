/** We use a simple recursive decent parser. Each grammar rule is specified
 * using the macros defined below. Whilst it is perfectly possible to mix
 * normal C code in with the macros it should not be necessary. The underlying
 * functions that the macros use should not be called outside of the macros.
 *
 * Note that we assume that no look ahead is needed.
 *
 * When called each rule tries to match its tokens and subrules in order. When
 * the first token or subrule is found then the rule is considered to be
 * matched and the rest of it must be found or a syntax error is declared. If
 * the first required token or subrule is not found the the rule is a miss and
 * reports "not found" to its caller. It is up to the caller to decide whether
 * this is an error.
 *
 * An optional token or subrule not found does not cause a miss, so rules can
 * safely start with optional items.
 *
 * Each rule returns one of 4 things:
 * 1. PARSE_ERROR - indicates that an error occurred. Parse errors are
 *    propogated up to the caller without re-reporting them.
 * 2. RULE_NOT_FOUND - indcates that the rule was not found. It is up to the
 *    caller whether this constitutes an error.
 * 3. An AST tree - generated from a successful rule parse. It is the
 *    responsibility to free the tree with ast_free().
 * 4. NULL - indicates a successful rule parse, but that rule generates no AST.
 *    This is perfectly legal for all rules except the top level initial rule.
 *
 * The AST nodes created from token and returned by subrules are built into a
 * tree for the rule. The first node found is the rule parent node and all
 * subsequent nodes are built up as its children.
 *
 * The AST_NODE macro adds a node with a specified ID. Specifying this at the
 * start of a rule will ensure that this is the parent node. For the sake of
 * efficiency the creation of such a node is deferred until such time as the
 * rule has matched or reached its end.
 *
 * Note that since we use a simple recursive descent approach we cannot handle
 * grammars including left recursive rules (ie a rule where the first element
 * is a recursive call to the same rule). Such rules will lead to infinite
 * loops and/or stack overflow.
