/** Passes

Throughout, the global AST is routed at TK_PROGRAM.
The symbol table at TK_PROGRAM and dataref at TK_PACKAGE are populated.


1. Parse

Turns a source file in an AST. Deliberately allows some illegal syntax to
enable better error reporting.

Expects Pony source file or string.

Adds AST routed at TK_MODULE to global tree.
Dataref at TK_MODULE is populated.


2. Parse fix

Checks for specific illegal syntax cases that the BNF allows. This allows for
better error reporting.

Expects AST subtree routed at TK_MODULE with type aliases unresolved and symbol
tables not yet populated.

Only modifies the AST by removing temporary nodes left in by the parser purely
to enable checking in this pass. If this passes then the AST is fully
syntactically correct.


3. Sugar

Expands an AST tree to put in the code we've let the programmer miss out. This
includes default capabilities, method return values, else blocks, "create" and
"apply" names. There are also some code rewrites, such as assignment to update
call and for loop to while loop. Note that some further sugar may be required
but cannot be performed until type checking occurs.

Expects AST subtree routed at TK_MODULE with type aliases unresolved and symbol
tables not yet populated.

Produces an AST with all defaults, etc filled in.
