/** We use a greedy algorithm that gives a reasonable trade-off between
 * computation (at compiletime) and resulting colour density (runtime memory).
 * We also employ various heuristics to improve our results.
 *
 * Main algorithm.
 *
 * The basic approach is that we determine all the types that use each method
 * name and then we try to group names that have disjoint type sets.
 *
 * Step 1.
 * First we walk the given AST finding type definitions. We store these in a
 * list and also take a count. This is all done purely as an optimisation for
 * later steps.
 *
 * Step 2.
 * We walk through our types finding all function and behaviour definitions.
 * For each unique name we create a name record. In each of these records we
 * note which types use that name. We implement this using a bitmap. Because we
 * know in advance how many types there are we can store this as an array of
 * uints.
 *
 * Step 3.
 * Various heuristics (see below).
 *
 * Step 4.
 * We run through our name records. For each one we run through the colours
 * already assigned. If the set of types using the current name has no
 * intersection with the types using the current assigned colour, then that
 * name is also assigned to that colour. The name's type set is unioned into
 * the colour's type set.
 *
 * If a name is not compatible with any assigned colour (or there are no
 * colours assigned yet) then that name is assigned to the first free colour.
 *
 * Step 5.
 * Various heuristics (see below).
 *
 * Step 6.
 * For each type we run over the assigned colour and determine the size of the
 * vtable needed for that type. Since we store the colours in (reverse) order,
 * the largest used colour for a type is the first one we find.
 *
 * Heuristics.
 *
 * No heuristics are implemented yet, but there are various planned. Most of
 * these reduce compiletime computation at the expense of vtable size.
 *
 * 1. A name that is used by most of the types is far less likely to be
 * compatible with other names, so checking against them is a waste of time.
 * For any name that is used by more than some proportion of the types,
 * don't try to combine that name with others.
 *
 * 2. Step 4 is O(n^2) on the number of names. To prevent this exploding for
 * large n break the names into multiple groups and combine each group
 * separately. Do not try and combination between these groups. A simple
 * approach is just to put the first n names in one group, the next n in
 * another, etc for some n. More complex approaches may or may not give better
 * results.
 *
 * 3. The resulting vtables are not used for correctness checking and do not
 * have to be tolerant of invalid accesses. Therefore they do not all have to
 * be the same size and each can stop after its last valid entry. This means
 * that the total size of the vtables can be reduced by reordering the colours.
 * As a first attempt simply sort the colours by the number of types that use
 * them.
