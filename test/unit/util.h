ast_replace:
build ast fragment from desc
compare asts

colour:
build module ast from desc (handling src deletion)
  could use source


lexer tests:
do tidy up in tear down function
have next_token test function, etc

parserapi test:
similar to lexer tests
compare existing ast to desc (handling src deletion)

scope:
compile until scope1 (check good)
run pass scope1
find sub tree(id)
find and check symbtab entry, present + not

sugar:
build ast fragment from desc
perform full pass
compare asts

type check:
build module ast from desc with symbtab entries (handling src deletion)
build ast fragment
find test node
add fragment to module
compare node type to desc (handling src deletion)
