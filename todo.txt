* Nested tuple access looks to the lexer like a float literal.
  Eg: x.1.2 lexes as x . 1.2

* Prevent defining names that differ only by case.
  Allow a type and an identifier to have the same name bar case, but only one
  type and one identifier.

* Strings. Escaping? Triple quoted string ending in " or containing """?
