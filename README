Building on Linux
=================

First, install LLVM 3.5 using your package manager. You may need to install zlib and ncurses as well.

This will build ponyc and compile helloworld:

$ make config=release
$ ./build/release/ponyc examples/helloworld

Building on Mac OSX
===================

First, install homebrew if you haven't already (http://brew.sh). Then brew llvm35, like this:

$ brew tap homebrew/versions
$ brew install llvm35

This will build ponyc and compile helloworld:

$ make config=release
$ ./build/release/ponyc examples/helloworld

Building on Windows
===================

The LLVM 3.5 prebuilt binaries for Windows do NOT include the LLVM development tools and libraries. Instead, you will have to build and install LLVM 3.5 from source. You will need to make sure that the path to LLVM/bin (location of llvm-config) is in your PATH variable.

You will also need to build and install premake5 (not premake4) from source. We need premake5 in order to support current versions of Visual Studio.

You may also need to install zlib and ncurses.

$ premake5 vs2013
$ Release build with Visual Studio (ponyc.sln)
$ ./build/release/ponyc examples/helloworld
